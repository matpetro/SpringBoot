What is Spring?
Java framework built to create an enterprise ready application.
Many modules we can use within the framework.
Makes it easy but includes a lot of configurations.

What is SpringBoot?
Extension of Spring that provides key benefits such as rapid
application development. Also easy to manage dependencies and
group them within the templates. It also includes auto configuration.
There is also embedded servers within SpringBoot. Best for microservices
within Java.
        
        Inversion of Control: Bad to create classes manually using things such as new ...
                              Rather we should give control to Spring to create the class objects
                              for us
        Dependency Injection: All the objects are created and beans are stored in a container. 
                              Spring has all the objects that can be directly used.
